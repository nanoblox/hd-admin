2025 Update Log:
https://devforum.roblox.com/t/-/3446058

Getting Started:
    - Keep HD Admin in 'Workspace' or 'ServerScriptService'
	- The model's name 'HD Admin' is used by commands - be careful not to change!
	- All commands are now located under Config -> Roles -> [Role]
	- Commands inherit all Roles above them
	- You can delete 'ThumbnailCamera' - this is used to give the model an image
