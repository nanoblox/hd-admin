	HD Admin Settings

	- Use this to configure player and system settings within HD Admin
	- For most users, you don't need to worry about editing this file
	- Roles (formerly Ranks) and Bans (formerly Banland) are now located under Config
	- Role Givers, such as Passes (formerly Gamepasses), Individuals, Goups, etc are
	  now located under 'Givers' within Config
	- Make sure to only edit the values within here if you're familiar with Luau
	  and HD Admin Settings, otherwise you risk breaking HD Admin
